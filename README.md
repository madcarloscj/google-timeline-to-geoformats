# google-timeline-to-geoformats
With the last changes on the google chronology to store it in the phone, the export of data from google takeout is no longer possible. There is an option available under Location > Timeline > Export Timeline data. This file is a json file that contains all the information of the chronology.
This project converts that google timeline export format to geoformats like geojson so that it can later be used in any Geographical Information System.
